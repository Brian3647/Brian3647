# Hello, github

Hi! Im VÃ­ctor (Brian_3647 in most social media) and I like coding.

It all started 2 years ago, when I was in a Discord server and I saw someone "Playing `visual studio code`" in the rich presence, and I didnt know what was that so I searched and found vscode. But... I still did'nt know what is for, so I installed it and saw that was to "code?" I didnt know nothing about. I accidentally pressed the extension button, without knowing that was the extension panel. Because of I didn't know what I was doing, I closed vscode and asked in the server what is vscode and what it does.

They explained me everything to me, what I could do if I learn to code.

Then, I start seeing online free courses of `JavaScript` in youtube, because I wanted to make discord bots as they did.

Today, I'm learning a little bit of c++ and some web developement.

## Git? What is that?

I also didnt know what was Git, Github etc. But when I was searching for js extensions in vscode I found "Git lens", and, I asked. Now days I use git and GitHub a lot.
